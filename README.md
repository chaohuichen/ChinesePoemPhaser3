# ChinesePoem Phaser3

Let's learn chinese Poem and enjoy playing a game!

This project was developed for the FUllstack Academy's "Stack-a-thon" where we tasked to create a project within 4 days. So, I build a mini game with Phaser3 that let player learning while playing.

## Setup

1. 🍴 Fork this repo to your own GitHub account (if you haven't done so already)
2. 🐑 After cloning to your local machine, install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. 🚀 Start it up! `npm start` will start a server running at http://localhost:8080. Head on over there in your browser, and navigate to the 'public/' directory, which is where the Phaser application is served.

## Features

-the player has to collect the matching chinese charater.
-the English translation after the player collect all the require chinese characters.

## Project Challenges

-the game logic are a bit challenge for me to figure out where should the character goes
-creat the chinese character sprite by using Piskel
